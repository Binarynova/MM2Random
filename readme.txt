Mega Man 2 Randomizer
by duckfist


Known Bugs

- You cannot beat Wily 5.  The teleporters are cleared in the wrong order as a side effect
of randomizing the weapons.
- In the Weapon Get screen, the wrong weapon will be shown. It just shows the original
  weapon awarded by that Robot Master.
- On the Stage Select screen, the wrong Robot Master portraits will be marked out after
  completing a level.  The portraits are marked out according to which weapons you
  currently have.  The Stage Select screen still operates normally, however, only allowing
  you to select stages you haven't played yet.
